## Scattering.jl

Scattering.jl is a Julia package that intends to provide fast scattering transforms of images, sounds and videos.
Scattering coefficients are powerful features for signal-based machine learning tasks, as they offer a great discriminability
while discarding non-informative variability, such as rigid motions, frequency transpositions, and elastic deformations.

Its design is inspired from the [scattering.m](https://github.com/lostanlen/scattering.m) toolbox, while taking advantage of
Julia's multiple dispatch and in-place operations. 

The package is under ongoing development and is planned to be released in the fall 2015.
